      <h1>Art 109 Three.js GLTF Model Loader (MODIFIED)</h1>
      <!-- <h2>
    Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
    This is an example of a three.js scene that makes use of a glTF 3D model.
    I chose this loader because glTF models are the preferred format for
    online 3D model display. <br />
    <br />This example uses server hosted versions of the core Three.js, glTF
    Loader and Orbit Control scripts. Documentation for loading 3D models in
    Three.js can be viewed at:<br />

      <!-- <p>
    <br />
    To add models and textures you will need to add them to your site. In the
    case of this example, I added the model to the assests folder, the scene
    script to the "scripts" folder, and the add-on scripts (glTF loader and etc.)
    to the "src" folder.
